## Accessing the debugger

Load a browser window pointed to `https://remotedev.io/local/` (or [load another monitoring tool](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/remotedev#monitoring)). When running in debug mode, the client application will connect via WebSocket to the monitoring tool to provide debugging functionality for application state, including time-travelling functionality.
